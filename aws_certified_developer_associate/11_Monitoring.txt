Introduction to CloudWatch
  Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service to monitor the health and performance of your AWS resources, as well as the applications that you run on AWS, and in your own datacenter.

  What can CloudWatch monitor? Pretty, much everything
    Compute:
      EC2 Instances
      Autoscaling groups
      Elastic Load Balancers
      Route53 Health Checks
      Lambda

    Storage and Content Delivery
      EBS Volumes
      Storage Gateway
      CloudFront

    Databases and Analytics
      DynamoDB tables
      ElastiCache nodes
      RDS Instances
      Redshift
      Elastic Map Reduce

    other
      SNS Topics
      SQS Queues
      API Gateway
      Estimated AWS charges

  The CloudWatch agent: define your own metrics

  CloudWatch Logs allows you to monitor operating systems and logs

  CloudWatch and EC2: All EC2 instances send key health and performance metrics to CloudWatch
    Default EC2 host-level metrics consist of CPU, network, disk, and status check.
    Metrics are stored indefinitely
    You can retrieve data from an EC2 or Elastic Load Balancer after the instance has been terminated.

  Operating System - Level Metrics
    By Default: EC2 does not send operating system-level metrics to CloudWatch
    CloudWatch Agent: BY installing the CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instances, you cna collect operating system metrics and send them to CloudWatch
    Operating System Metrics; Memory usage, processes running on your instance, amount of freee disk space, CPU idle time, etc.

  How frequently does ec2 send metrics to cloudwatch?
    Metric Frequency: By default, 5 minute intervals
      For additional charge, you can enable detailed monitoring at 1 minute intervals

      For custom metrics, the default is 1 minute intervals and you can configure 1 second interval for additional charages

  Monitoring System and Application Logs
    Monitor Log Files: Monitor and troubleshoot your applications using existing system and application log Files
    Customize For Your Application: Monitor your logs in near-real time for specific phrases, values or patterns.
      Requires the CloudWatch agent

    Use Case: Track the number of errors that occur in your application log and send yourself a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify.

  CloudWatch Alarms: You can create an alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account
    Alarms: This can include EC2 cpu utilization, Elastic Load Balancer latency, or even the charges on your bill.
    Thresholds: YOu can set appropriate thresholds to trigger the alarms and actions to be taken if an alarm state is reached.
    Use Case: You can set an alarm that send you a notificaiton or executes an Auto Scaling policy if CPU utilization exceeds 90% on your EC2 instance for more than 5 minutes.

  Exam Tips:
    CloudWatch is all about monitoring the performance and health of your systems.
    
    Default EC2 host-level metrics: CPU, network, disk, and status check.

    Use the CLoudWatch agent for operating system-level metrics like memory usage, processes and CPU idle time.

    CloudWatch Logs: Monitor and store your lgos to help you better understand your systems and applications
    CloudWatch Alarms: You can create an alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account, generate an alert or take some action.

CloudWatch vs CloudTrail 
  What is CloudTrail? Records user activity in your AWS account.
    CloudTrail records events related to creation, modification, or deletion of resources.
    By default, you can view the last 90 days of account activity

  When to use CloudWatch and CloudTrail?
    CloudWatch:
      Perfmance and metrics
      CloudWatch Logs
      CloudWatch Alarms

    CloudTrail:
      Records API calls for your AWS account
      Delivers log files containing API calls to an S3 bucket.
      Can be integrated with CloudWatch Logs

    Understand The Difference!
      Do you need to monitor the performance and health of AWS resources? CloudWatch
      Do you need an audit log of your AWS account? CloudTrail
