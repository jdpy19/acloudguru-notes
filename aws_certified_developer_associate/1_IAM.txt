  Centralized control of your aws account
  Shared access to your aws account
  Granular permissions
  Identity Federation (Active Directory, Facebook, LInkedin, etc.)

Critical Terms
  Users - End Users (people)
  Groups - A collection of users under one set of permissions
  Roles - Create a role and assign them to AWS resources
